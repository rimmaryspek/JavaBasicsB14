// What does a SDET do: Test the software web.sites like FB,amazon.... 
// we will be checking if the web sites are working. As a SDET we will be testing all those w s automatically, we wont be testing manually, because it very slow.
// F.ex. Bobs manager wants him to below task.
// --- Bob and his both should understand written English.
// ---Bob should be able to perform this task.
// 	If we want a computer to do something: what we need?
// we need to provide information to a computer and instruction.
// The question will be how to do? and what to do?
// Types of Java:The re are two main date types; 
// ***Primitive and Non primitives***.(Date types). Non primiteves-(Srting) are basic requires a lot work some time to store informations.
// ***Primitive data type (8 types) are very efficient and storing the data type 
// 	Lets discuss the Primitive: 
// What are the primitive DT? - are use to store the info in a comp program.
// Why i should use PDT? - because all other types are built there primitives. They require min memory to store info.		
// How can i use Primitive DT? - 1. we need to specify the DT (it can be PRIM and NON Prim) 2. we need to give the name to the box so that we can back this info if we need this info in the future.		
//3. we can use = to store the info. F.Ex ---Int box1=12;
		
// If we want to store whole numbers below DT numbers without decimal part like: 10.20.30.1000000000.etc but, we can not use them to decimal like 1.1,2.2....
//--byte
//--short
//--int
//--long	although above 4 DT can be used to store WN but we will be using int at the time as it can handle ud to billions and does not waste a lot of from Ram (type of memory that can store programs which are opened and running currently ).	
	int box1=12;// we can update/replace the values any time. 
	int box2=30;
	System.out.println(box1);
	System.out.println(box2);
