// Type casting => type = date type casting =>converting
		// converting one date type to another
		// why do we use type casting? to use someone's existing code 
		//What is the syntax foe type casting.
		// when we convert something smaller to large we won't get any error
		//If we converting large dt to small dt then
		// we can convert long(DT) to short(DT)
		// Casting or converting is only primitives 
		// 
		int box=123;
long b1=box; // this is called implicit or widening automatic/ explicit/automating type casting-- when java java converts the dt automatically for us it only happens when we assgn a smaller dt to a larger dt.
		
/*Explicit/narrowing/manual type casting: 
when we convert a large dt to a smaller dt its call of the above. it does't not happen automatically we have to do it explicitly
Manually.
	why we should be leaning type casting ?	 
When we write a code a our real life most the we use the code from others to save time.and we might also need to convert the date type to make out code compatible.
what is the syntax for date casting?
we use (parentessence)and the () we write the destination dt to F.Ex long var1=250; int var2=(int)var1: -- its Explicit/N/M
double va3=var2;/-----/ Implicit/widening /automatic.

float f=250.5f;
double d=f; Implicit/widening /automatic.

===============================================================
if else conditions;
  If else conditions can help us write a code that can take a decision based on date.
Because when we are solving a real problem like testing on a web site, our programs need to make a lots of decisions.
If (the program username and password matches)
{go to home page} else {give user a warning}
what is the syntax for if else conditions.
boolean ishungry=true;
if(ishungry) {
systom.out.println(Please eat something);
}else{
system.out.println.(lets build some java program);

=================================================
Nested if Conditions:


Loops - is a statement that repeat same code too many times.

int time=12;
system.out.print
