why do we need to test?
To assure the the quality of the software,we need to test it.

STLC
1-Requirement Analysis- 

to test we use SMART criteria
S- specific- requirements
M-measurable - time based/
A-Attainable - double or achievable / 
R-Relevant/ 
T- time box/ due date

test planing
what we are going to test? how we gonna test? where we gonna test? decision by manager or QA lean


Test Case development- 

Testing Heirarchy

Developers- where the developers will  develop they application
test- where the testers star performs
staging- when the client testers performs
Production ready to the market

Why bugs Occur?
1) what we should do if find a bug? Verify if it is reproducible or not or test many times.
Read the req to make sure that the bug you found is actually bugs.
2) Intermittent bugs (somatime's they appear sometimes they don't).

BUG LIFE CYCLE
----How to report it?----

1. Collect as much as possible ... f.ex exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
- Browser.time,the environment.test data,logs,screenshots or screen recording.
2.
Two ways to report

Severity - level of the bug/defect or seriousness
Priority - it defines the order in which our bug should be fixed.
 4 type of priotity
 high
 low 
 medium
  
 Cucumber / BDD (behaver driven development approach) -- Gherkin language . it allows to write test case.yh
 
 4 Tags to lean on cucumber
 
 Every scenario in BDD representive a test case
 Given - it represents pre-condition
 When - to performs
 Then - expected result
 And - supporting tag
 
 Scenario - Verify the login functionality for amazon
 
 Given- user able to access amazon application in browser
 When - enter user name in username textfield
 And  - user enters password in password textfield
 And - user clicks on log in button
 Then- user should be able to see home page
 
 It is recommended and best to write cucumber scenarios in third point of view
  
 
 Home work 
 Write 5 cucumber test cases due by Saturday 3pm for amazon.com 
 
 
 Types of testing;
 Functional and non functional
 
 What is Functional - is to check the functionality all the testing.
 What id non functionality - backed testing behind the screen 
 
 Diferrents of testing:
 
 -----Regression testing - Test all the scenarios .Testing to the complete functionality 
  // all the test cases call regression testing. Done by QA.
 
--Unit testing or component testing is every dev responsible for own unit or module. Only one part and only dev can test.
 
---Integration testing - QA - test - dev -development integration or complete application.
 
 ---System testing -- everything will be testedyes
  (Data base, API, all of it).
 
 Smoke testing - is quick test usually automated. quick test before launching the product.
